We create a 2D DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `str1` and `str2`, respectively. The extra row and column are used for base cases.\n2. We initialize the first row and column of the DP table with zeros.\n3. We iterate through the characters of `str1` and `str2` and fill the DP table.\n   - If the characters at the current positions are equal, we add 1 to the length of the LCS up to the previous positions.\n   - If the characters are different, we take the maximum length of LCS without including either character.\n4. The value in `dp[m][n]` gives the length of the LCS.\n\nTime Complexity: The algorithm uses nested loops to fill the DP table, resulting in a time complexity of O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the input strings.\n\nSpace Complexity: The algorithm uses a 2D DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, so the space complexity is O(mn). However, we can optimize the space complexity to O(min(m, n)) by using a 1D DP table and storing only the previous row or column."

At each step:\n1. We skip any non-alphanumeric characters from the left using a while loop.\n2. We skip any non-alphanumeric characters from the right using another while loop.\n3. We compare the lowercase characters at the `left` and `right` pointers. If they are not equal, the string is not a palindrome, so we return `False`.\n4. If the characters match, we increment `left` and decrement `right` to move the pointers inward.\n\nIf we complete the iteration without returning `False`, it means all the alphanumeric characters matched, and the string is a valid palindrome, so we return `True`.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we process each character at most once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers."

Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `n` with all elements set to 1, representing the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.\n\n2. Iterate through the array from index 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, consider all elements before it (index `j` from 0 to `i-1`).\n\n3. If `arr[i] > arr[j]`, it means we can extend the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `j` by including `arr[i]`. Update `dp[i]` as the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.\n\n4. After the iterations, the maximum value in the `dp` array represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the entire array.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n)."
