Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple application servers for optimal performance and fault tolerance. Uses algorithms like round-robin or least connections.\n\n2. Application Servers: Handle business logic, process requests, and generate responses. Stateless for easy scaling. Multiple servers deployed across different availability zones for high availability.\n\n3. Caching Layer: In-memory cache (like Redis) to store frequently accessed data. Reduces load on databases and improves response times. Distributed cache deployed in a cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.\n\n4. Database: Stores persistent data. Sharded and replicated for scalability and high availability. Master-slave replication for read-heavy workloads. Eventual consistency model for faster writes.\n\n5. Message Queue: Decouples components and enables asynchronous processing. Handles tasks like notifications, updates, and background jobs. Ensures reliable delivery and prevents data loss.\n\n6. Content Delivery Network (CDN): Caches static content (images, videos) closer to users. Reduces load on origin servers and improves loading speeds. Multiple edge locations worldwide for low latency.\n\nInteractions:\n- Requests hit the load balancer, which routes them to an available application server.\n- Application servers first check the cache for data. If not found, they query the database.\n- Writes are committed to the database and then updated in the cache.\n- Async tasks are published to the message queue for background processing.\n- Static content is served from the CDN, reducing load on application servers.\n\nThis design ensures high availability through redundancy, fault tolerance via multiple instances, and scalability by allowing components to scale independently based on load."

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The Singleton pattern is an example of a creational pattern.\n\n2. Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures. Examples include the Adapter and Facade patterns.\n\n3. Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects and how responsibility is distributed among them. The Observer and Strategy patterns are examples of behavioral patterns.\n\nTo apply the Singleton pattern for a logging service in a web application:\n\n1. Create a private constructor for the Logger class to prevent direct instantiation.\n\n2. Define a private static instance variable to hold the single Logger instance.\n\n3. Implement a public static getInstance() method that checks if an instance exists. If not, it creates one and returns the single instance. \n\n4. Throughout the application, call Logger.getInstance() to get the logger and use its methods for logging.\n\nThis ensures only one Logger instance is created and shared across the application, providing a centralized logging mechanism. It avoids creating multiple loggers that could cause inconsistency and performance issues."

        "role": "Candidate",
        "message": "When designing a caching mechanism for a web application serving dynamic content, some key considerations are:\n\n1. Cache invalidation - Ensuring cached data is kept in sync with the source data. This may involve time-based expiration, event-driven invalidation, or a combination. The right approach depends on data volatility and consistency requirements.\n\n2. Cache granularity - Deciding what to cache. Options include caching full HTML pages, fragments of pages, query results, or API responses. More granular caching provides flexibility but adds complexity. The choice depends on how dynamic the data is and the desired caching benefits.\n\n3. Cache location - Caches can be client-side (browser), server-side, CDN, or a multi-level combination. Server-side caching is most common for dynamic content. Distributed caching can help scale but adds network overhead. The right location(s) depend on factors like request volume, geography, and security needs.\n\n4. Eviction policies - As a cache fills up, an eviction policy determines what data gets removed. Common options are LRU, LFU, or FIFO. The optimal policy depends on access patterns and the cache size vs churn rate.\n\nIn terms of strategies and scenarios:\n\n- For highly dynamic, uncacheable content, caching page fragments or API responses and stitching them together can still provide some performance benefit.\n\n- For content personalized to the user, consider caching generic versions and doing lightweight customization. Session-specific data can be cached separately. \n\n- For rapidly changing data, a short TTL is needed or a push-based invalidation mechanism from the data source.\n\n- For slowly changing, expensive to render content, a long TTL with a stale-while-revalidate approach can improve perceived performance.\n\nThe key is striking the right balance between freshness, latency and complexity for the specific application. A layered caching approach is often best, gracefully degrading and providing increasing benefits for more cacheable content."

Loose coupling: Each microservice should be independent and encapsulated, with minimal dependencies on other services. This allows for easier development, testing, and deployment.\n\n2. Single responsibility: Each microservice should focus on a specific business capability or domain, such as product catalog, order management, or payment processing. This promotes modularity and maintainability.\n\n3. Autonomy: Microservices should be able to make their own decisions and have control over their own data. This enables faster development and reduces coordination overhead.\n\nFor service boundaries, I would identify the core business domains and define microservices around them. For example:\n\n- Product Catalog Service: Manages product information, categories, and inventory.\n- Order Management Service: Handles order placement, tracking, and fulfillment.\n- Payment Service: Processes payments and integrates with external payment gateways.\n- User Service: Manages user authentication, authorization, and profiles.\n\nThese services would have clear boundaries and well-defined APIs for communication.\n\nFor communication mechanisms, I would use:\n\n1. REST APIs: Synchronous communication for request-response interactions between services.\n2. Message queues: Asynchronous communication for event-driven architectures, enabling loose coupling and fault tolerance. Examples include Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.\n3. API Gateway: Acts as a single entry point for external clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting.\n\nI would also consider using a service registry and discovery mechanism, such as Consul or Eureka, to enable dynamic service registration and discovery."

The dataset is split based on a shard key, such as user ID or geographic region. This allows distributing the read/write load and storage requirements across shards.\n\nTo implement sharding for the social media platform:\n\n1. Choose an appropriate shard key, like user ID. This ensures related data for a user is co-located on the same shard.\n\n2. Develop a sharding strategy and algorithm to map data to specific shards based on the shard key. Consistent hashing is commonly used to evenly distribute data.\n\n3. Set up multiple database servers, each hosting a subset of shards. The number of shards can grow as data and traffic increases.  \n\n4. Modify the application to be shard-aware. Database queries need to include the shard key to route requests to the correct shard.\n\n5. Implement a centralized config to map shard keys to database hosts. This allows adding shards without downtime.\n\n6. Set up data replication and failover within each shard for high availability.\n\n7.

Anycast routing or DNS-based routing can be used to route requests to the optimal server based on factors like location, server load, and network conditions.\n\n3.
