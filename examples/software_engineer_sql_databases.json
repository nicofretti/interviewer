There can only be one clustered index per table. It's best used for columns that are frequently used for sorting or are accessed sequentially.\n\nIn contrast, a non-clustered index creates a separate structure from the table data. It contains the non-clustered index key values and row locators pointing to the data. A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes. Non-clustered indexes are used to improve query performance on columns that are frequently searched by specific values or used in JOIN conditions, but aren't typically sorted or accessed sequentially.\n\nFor example, if you often query a \"Users\" table by \"LastName\" and sort by \"DateOfBirth\", it would be beneficial to create a clustered index on \"DateOfBirth\" and a non-clustered index on \"LastName\". This would optimize searches by last name while keeping the table data sorted by date of birth for efficient sequential access."

It establishes a link between two tables. You use a foreign key when you need to create associations and enforce referential integrity between related tables.\n\nFor example, in a database for an online store:\n- The \"Products\" table would have a primary key \"ProductID\". \n- The \"Orders\" table would have a foreign key \"ProductID\" that references the primary key in the \"Products\" table. This links each order to a specific product.\n\nSo in summary, use a primary key to uniquely identify records in a table, and use foreign keys to create relationships between tables."

This removes duplicated data.\n\n2. 2NF (Second Normal Form): In addition to 1NF, all non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key. Partial dependencies are removed by splitting tables. This further reduces redundancy.\n\n3. 3NF (Third Normal Form): In addition to 2NF, there must be no transitive dependencies, meaning non-prime attributes can't depend on other non-prime attributes. Data is split into additional tables to remove these dependencies.\n\nHigher normal forms like BCNF and 4NF exist for more complex scenarios.\n\nThe benefits of normalization include:\n- Minimizing data redundancy, saving storage space\n- Avoiding data anomalies and inconsistencies during updates\n- Simplifying data management and ensuring referential integrity\n- Enabling easier schema evolution as requirements change\n\nBy applying normalization, the database becomes more maintainable, scalable, and free of update and deletion anomalies."

You use a UNION when you want to combine data from multiple tables or queries into a single set of rows, stacking them vertically.

Read Committed: Transactions only read committed data, preventing dirty reads. However, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can still occur due to data changes made by other transactions.\n\n3. Repeatable Read: Transactions see a consistent snapshot of the data throughout their execution. Non-repeatable reads are prevented, but phantom reads can still happen when new rows are inserted.\n\n4. Serializable: The highest isolation level. Transactions appear to execute serially, preventing all consistency issues (dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads).

Each transaction should have the illusion of being the only one executing, and intermediate states should not be visible to other transactions.\n\nDurability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes persist permanently, even in the event of system failures.

An example is Students enrolling in Courses.

Database operations are centralized, allowing changes to be made in one place. This also enhances security by limiting direct table access.\n\nFor example, at my previous company we had a complex pricing calculation involving many tables. Moving this logic into a stored procedure reduced code duplication in the application and improved calculation speed by orders of magnitude.

Better performance: Queries can be executed faster as each shard contains a smaller subset of the overall data.\n3. Increased storage capacity: The total storage capacity can be increased by adding more shards.\n\nHowever, sharding also presents some challenges:\n1. Complexity: Sharding introduces complexity in the application and database architecture. The application needs to be aware of the sharding scheme and route queries to the appropriate shard.\n2. Data distribution: Ensuring an even distribution of data across shards can be challenging, especially if the data has a skewed access pattern.\n3. Cross-shard queries: Queries that require data from multiple shards can be difficult to execute efficiently and may require additional coordination.\n4. Maintenance: Managing and maintaining multiple shard instances can be more complex compared to a single database instance.\n\nTo implement sharding successfully, it's important to choose an appropriate sharding key, use a consistent hashing algorithm for data distribution, and have a robust monitoring and management system in place to handle the increased operational complexity."
